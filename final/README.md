## 📌 Overview  
This project integrates a **Task Manager**, a **Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS)**, and a simple **AI Agent** into one terminal-based Python application.

- Creating, listing, and deleting tasks  
- Creating, listing, and deleting notes  
- Storing all data in JSON files  
- Chat-style command interface  
- AI task summarization (offline + optional online mode)

The project follows the CSC299 requirement of developing iterative prototypes from `tasks1` through `tasks5`, with the final version stored entirely in the **final/** directory.
