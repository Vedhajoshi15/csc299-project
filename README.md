# Vedha’s Knowledge & Task Manager  
Final Project — CSC 299 (Fall 2025)

A terminal-based Python application that combines **task management**, **note-taking (PKMS)**, and a lightweight **AI agent** to help organize your work, ideas, and productivity.  
This project demonstrates AI-assisted software development, iterative prototyping, and specification-driven design.
