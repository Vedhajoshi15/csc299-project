# Task 1 Prototype – CSC299 Project

## Overview
This folder contains the first prototype for my CSC299 final project.  
It’s a simple command-line **Task Management System** written in Python.

The program lets you:
- Add new tasks  
- List all tasks stored in a JSON file  

This satisfies the October 20 milestone requirement:
> “Create a prototype command-line application that allows storing, listing, and searching tasks stored in a JSON data file.”

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal (Git Bash or Command Prompt).  
2. Navigate to this folder:
   ```bash
   cd csc299-project/task1
