# Task 3 – Automated Testing with Pytest (CSC299)

## Overview
Task 3 introduces **automated testing** for my project using the `pytest` framework.  
It includes a simplified version of my Note Manager code (from Task 2) and tests for adding and searching notes.  
The project is built and managed using **`uv`**, a fast Python package manager.

---

## Features Tested
- ✅ Adding a note creates and saves data in `notes.json`
- ✅ Searching notes finds correct results based on keywords
- ✅ All tests run automatically using `pytest`

---

## How to Run the Tests
1. Open a terminal in the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd csc299-project/tasks3
